# Data_Minions
## Team Members
Yiran Xu:

I’m a full-time second year master student in the Data Science program. Prior to my graduate study, I obtained double degrees in Economics/ Mathematics with minors in Computer Science and Statistics from Iowa State University. During my undergraduate, I got intensive training in data structure and algorithm, programming in Java, statistical data analysis and visualization in R, and obtained a solid mathematical and economics foundation. During the time in NYU, I obtained rigorous training in Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, Optimization, Big Data and programming in Python. In the past summer, I interned at Factset, a financial software company, and created a hierarchical industrial classification algorithm using description data.

Yang Sun

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree of B.A in applied mathematics. Then I worked as an assistant associate in Treasury department, Bank of China, New York branch, where I initially analyzed term structure of Brokered CD, Yankee CD, Commercial Paper  and their issuance, and then assisted senior traders with foreign currency trading, and precious metal trading. Afterwards, I resigned and became 1-year professional poker player. Currently, I’m a second-year graduate student in NYU’s Data Science program; even though I do not have a strong background in coding, I’m very interested in solving data related problems, decision models and analytics as well as machine learning algorithms.

Shangying Jiang

I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Statistics, Mathematics and Actuarial Science from Purdue University where I built up a solid background in Mathematics and Statistics, such as Linear Algebra, programming in R and Python, optimization and statistical analysis. I’m a senior graduate student of NYU’s Master of Data Science Program where I’ve been extensively exposed to machine learning algorithms, Python programming and huge amount of data.

Zhaopeng Liu

I graduated from UIUC with B.S degree in statistics and had two minors in computer science and mathematics. I built solid background in statistical analysis and programming during my undergraduate study. Currently, I’m a second-year student in the data science program. In the last year, I took several courses related to machine learning, implemented some widely used algorithm and did have a good understanding of them. Besides, I’m familiar with how to deal with big data set with Spark on the cluster.

Yidi Zhang

I am a full-time second year student in CDS. I graduated from Shandong University with B.S in Computer Science. From February to August this year, I worked as senior data scientist in Centiment.io, using deep learning techniques to do sentiment analysis on large social media data sets. I have experience in Tensorflow, PyTorch, Hadoop, Spark, NLTK, web development as well as many machine learning packages and build up strong skills in programing in python and java. I am very interested in NLP, image processing and finance predictive model related projects.

## Reason for teaming up
All members of our team share the similar interests even if we have diverse backgrounds, which means every member can make contribution to the project in different aspects. And for a number of projects, interdisciplinary thinking is necessary. For instance, capital one (2) requires a lot of knowledges, including programming, mathematics, finance, marketing, big data as well as NLP. And every member's skills in our group are essential for generating an ideal predictive model. We believe every member can make up for the lack of knowledge of the rest members and help each other learn more knowledges through working together in capstone project. Besides, through discussion, we find our team members can communicate with each other perfectly and work collaboratively.

## Top 3 project choices

### Project title: Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation
This is quite a challenging project as it’s very time-consuming and requires the group members have both good coding skills and an in-depth understand some machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We think this is a good choice for us, since we have 5 people in the group, which is an advantages to fully tackle down the problem apart and work on each part smoothly. Besides, the project get involved in big data handling, image processing and deep learning techniques like CNN, each member in the group is either familiar or proficient on these topics, we think this project would be an appropriate choice for us to sharpen the skills without struggling too much.

### Project title: Capital One 2
Our group members are very interested in this project because it utilizes many big data tools and machine learning algorithms, which are two essential domains of data science. We believe it will enrich our experiences in developing how data science is related with real-world financial industry. Yang and Shangying have background in US market, so are relatively familiar with how FED influences US market movements, whereas other members have decent background in coding, so we believe a detailed job arrangement will improve our project result.

### Project title: Industrial Representation and Classification via Deep Learning
As a group, we regard Industrial Classification as very important topic for both Financial Market and Economic Research. By accomplishing this project, not only can we get hands-on experiences on how to do research project, we can also learn important skills that will be heavily used in our future jobs.  These skills include extracting features from unstructured data, learning new business concepts quickly, and building machine learning/ deep learning models to reach our goals. how to validate model results. Therefore, we believe we will have a competitive advantage at job market after accomplishing this project. With five people in the group from diverse background, we can learn from each other and help tackle this hard project together.
